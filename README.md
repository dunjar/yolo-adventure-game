# Team Pooky Submission to Koding Global Virtual Hackathon

This is a repo for our moddable **HTML5 educational Adventure Game Quiz** – YOLO, a personal hygierne game. Work in progress, currently an awesome **DEMO** version 0.1

The game is made so that it's really easy to change the topic of your quiz or enter new questions and answers.

Unfortunatelly we ran out of time, wanted to use PubNub API so at the time, only one player mode is implemented with 'simulated Player2'. Here we explain the whole idea, with all features (also ones to be added).


####Main features:    

Easily chanegable questions and quiz theme; 

Educational;

Design for kids;

One on one quiz, compete with opponent, not just answer (to be done); 

Questions related to previous question; adventure


##Description

With the recent Ebola outbreak and subsequent worldwide panic in mind, we believe in prevention and common sense - it's so much much better to act before it's too late. Panic without the understanding bacteria or viruses is not good.

As trivial as it may seem, the little things that we can do every day by the way can make a huge difference – like washing hands, being carefull when dealing with raw meat.

Of course it's not just that easy – but it is a start and if we can convince a child, that hand washing isn't something adults came up with just to taunt him or her, our goal is complete. 

Therefore our project addresses the 4. theme: _HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented. (multiplayer preferred)_ with a game, called: **YOLO, a personal hygiene game**. We call it YOLO, because yes, you only live once and you should enjoy life, but risking to get sick because of poor personal hygiene just doesn't make any sense. 

YOLO, a personal hygierne game is a multiplayer text adventure game, where two players compete in real time quiz for points. Both players answer the same question at the same time. The questions are situation oriented and you have to pick the right thing to do in that situation. If you pick the right one, you score. 

Most games to educate kids are made in a way that you have to guide a cartoon character to do something and it is almost impossible to do it wrong. YOLO, personal hygiene game, makes a child think about the situation he might be facing in real life one day. When he or she sees the score of the other player it's a motivation to answer even better and get more points than the other player. In that way you don't loose the child's attention. And we used a lot of bright colors.

There are just two options for every situation, so the player knows which answer is correct even if he or she chooses the wrong one. If necessary, more can be added.

You can also easily change the background graphics and use other questions or situations and change the topic you want your kids to learn. 

So, wash your hands – YOLO!
